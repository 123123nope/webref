As another example, the its:dir and dirRule element of the Internationalization Tag Set [ITS20] are able to define the directionality of an element in [XML10]."

Each language range in :lang() must be a valid CSS <ident> or <string>.

If the hyperlink’s target includes a fragment URL, then the fragment URL of the current URL must also match; if it does not, then the fragment URL portion of the current URL is not taken into account in the comparison."

For example, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the cursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element. Interactive user agents that cannot detect hovering due to hardware limitations (e.g., a pen device that does not detect hovering) are still conforming; the selector will simply never match in such a UA."

The :focus-visible pseudo-class matches a focused element (or pseudo-element) in these situations only, allowing authors to change the appearance of the focus indicator without changing when a focus indicator appears."
