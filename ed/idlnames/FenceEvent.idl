dictionary FenceEvent {
  // This dictionary has two mutually exclusive modes that arenâ€™t represented as
  // distinct IDL types due to distinguishability issues:
  //
  // When reporting to a preregistered destination (specified by enum), the following
  // properties are used:
  DOMString eventType;
  DOMString eventData;
  sequence<FenceReportingDestination> destination;

  // When setting event data to be used later in an automatic beacon, the
  // following properties are used:
  boolean once = false;
  boolean crossOriginExposed = false;

  // When reporting to a custom destination URL (with substitution of macros defined by
  // the Protected Audience buyer), the following property is used:
  USVString destinationURL;
